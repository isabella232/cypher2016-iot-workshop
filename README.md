# IoT Workshop

This is a complete dump of all the things that I used when giving a talk at
"Cypher 2016".  My talk was entitled "Adding to the Mess" and it was a one
hour work shop.

I used a couple of demos to go with the talk, but they won't work here on
GitHub.  You'll need to checkout the repo, so some amount of set up and run a
server locally.  Look for instructions below.

   - [Presentation](/presentation): Built using [Impress.js](http://github.com/impress/impress.js). Press 'p' to bring up the speaker console. Use 'c' to toggle the "Vote Count"
   - [Audience Poll](/poll): A somewhat cheesy audience vote counter demo
   - [RFMON](/rfmon): A demo tracker application created using a router running DD-WRT

## Running It Locally

### Equipment

The [Audience Poll](/poll) requires a connected webcam. Ideally looking out into the audiece.

The [RFMON](/rfmon) demo requires a router running DD-WRT that has been placed
in monitor mode.  More instructions below.

Checkout the repository and do 

```
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
